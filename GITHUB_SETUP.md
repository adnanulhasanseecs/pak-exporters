# GitHub Setup Guide

## ✅ Commit Complete!

Your code has been committed locally. Now you need to:

1. **Create a GitHub repository** (if you haven't already)
2. **Add the remote**
3. **Push your code**

---

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
2. Click "New repository"
3. Name it: `pak-exporters` (or your preferred name)
4. **Don't** initialize with README (you already have one)
5. Click "Create repository"

---

## Step 2: Add Remote and Push

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
# Add remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pak-exporters.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin master
```

**Or if you prefer SSH:**

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/pak-exporters.git
git push -u origin master
```

## Alternative: I Can Help You Push

If you provide your GitHub repository URL, I can help you:
1. Add the remote
2. Push the code

Just share the repository URL when ready!
